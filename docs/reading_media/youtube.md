PREDICTING is safer than FOLLOWING BLINDLY

1. TypeScript
  - teams
  - TypeScript takes over the JS world:
    - TS is the most common choice for new commercial JS project(by end of 2020)
    - more people writing TS daily than JS without TS(by end of 2025)
2. Web Assembly
  - run "almost-machine-code" in the browser
  - run much faster than JS
  - WASM expands the Web App pie
    - wasm makes no signification difference to the makeup of the Web(by the end of 2020) 
    - wasm has created a new niche of heavyweight web apps
3. Packages
  - [bower](https://bower.io/), [entropic](https://www.entropic.dev/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn]() and [github Pacakge Registry]
  - left pad: someone **unpublished packages** and broke a lot of people's workflows
  - event-stream: malicious package
  - `npm config set ignore-scripts true`
  - npm lasts, surviving further problems
    - at least one new npm security incident makes headlines(by the end of 2020)
    - at least one malicious npm package has infected many dev's machines(by the end of 2025)
4. Compile-to-JS
